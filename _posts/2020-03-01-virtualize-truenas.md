Do you want a DIY NAS?  Do you want to set up TrueNAS?  Have you considered virtualizing TrueNAS with Proxmox?  In this video we'll walk through installing and setting up TrueNAS and configure a samba share for Windows.  We'll also install it on a virtual server using ProxmoxVE that's running in my Homelab.  Both are free and open source.
