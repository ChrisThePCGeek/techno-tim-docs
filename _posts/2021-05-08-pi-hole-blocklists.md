In some of my previous Pi-Hole videos many of you spotted my blocklist with over a millions sites added and you wondered how you can do the same.  Well, today I show you how to block more ads, block more tracking, block more malware, and block more telemetry with these community lists.  Bonus (and spoiler alert) I show you how to add 3.5 million!

Thanks to Firebog for the great lists [firebog.net](https://firebog.net/)
