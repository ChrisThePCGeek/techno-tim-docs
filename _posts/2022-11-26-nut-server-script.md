Here's a quick way to automate your battery backups and UPSes with and open source service called NUT server and a raspberry Pi.

## NUT Server Install script

Be sure to check out (and star) the repo with an automated NUT server install!

‚≠ê <https://github.com/dzomaya/NUTandRpi>

## Instructions

Be sure you have a raspberry pi or any machine running Debian / Ubuntu Linux.  Then plug in your UPS via USB and then SSH into your Pi.

Then download th script.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzomaya/NUTandRpi/main/scripts/nutinstall.sh
```

Make the script executable.

```bash
sudo chmod +x nutinstall.sh
```

Run the script.

```bash
sudo ./nutinstall.sh
```

Answer a few questions.

Be sure to keep your SNMP community string safe and treat this like a password.

You can now access NUT in a browser by going to:

<http://yourRasberryPiIPaddress/cgi-bin/nut/upsstats.cgi>

You can also query your device using SNMP

```bash
snmpwalk -v2c -c yourSNMPv2cCommunity yourRasberryPiIPaddress .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.1.3.2.4.1.2
```
