## Me

Hi!  My name is Tim but most people call me "Techno Tim".  I create content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@technotim), [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/technotim), and various other [social platforms](https://links.technotim.live/).

Here you will find all the documentation for my YouTube videos on my [channel](https://l.technotim.live/subscribe).  This documentation is meant to compliment my videos and not replace them.

If you see something that needs to be fixed, this documentation is open source so feel free to open an issue or pull request [on the repo](https://github.com/techno-tim/techno-tim.github.io).

You can support this project and many others by becoming a[patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/technotim) or a [sponsor on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/timothystewart6).  Thank you for your consideration and for visiting!
